                Ashley Guarquila is a first-year Architecture student, currently enrolled at NJITâ€™s Hillier College of Architecture and Design.<br>
                Her passion for Architecture began during her senior year of highschool attending a Theatre based Workshop class, where assignments<br>
                revolving around the building of set models and theaters sparked her interest in the art of structural creation. Within her own theatre career,<br>
                Ashley has participated in ensemble work and backstage handling, with more experience within the latter. Her experience in theatre and the <br>
                background work in maintenance and creation of sets inspired her to pursue a career in Architecture to work within the theatre industry.
