        Hi my name is Stella Frias, and I'm an international student-athlete from Brazil. I'm a first year and also part of the fencing team here at NJIT. I've been fencing for ten years now, and I can say that the sport was the main reason why I chose to come to the US. Since I'm also majoring in architecture, it's really important for me to have the school's support within the sport. And that's something you can only get here in the US. So I'm really happy to be here and I'm excited meet new people!
