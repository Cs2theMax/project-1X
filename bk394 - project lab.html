        <p>  Brianna Kailas is an aspiring architect whose goal is to open up her open firm. <br> As a firsth generation American, Brianna is very grateful for the sacrifices her parents made.  Brianna went to school at Middletown at Middletown High School North. <br>  In high school she received many awards such as making varsity from sophomore year for volleyball and softball, being a varsity captain for the volleyball team, making the list for most digs in Monmouth County, getting honor roll, joining RHO Kappa (Social Studies Honor Society), and National Honor Society. <br>  As a senior, Brianna took Technical Drawing where she was introduced to the world of architecture and construction. Her teacher was a huge impact on her life and got her to where she is today. <br> After finishing high school, Brianna continued her studies at New Jersey’s Institute of Technology as an architect major. She plans on finishing her studies in architecture and minoring in civil engineering. This is only the beginning of Brianna’s journey as an architect and it is most certainly not the end.
